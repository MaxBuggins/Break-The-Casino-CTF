### Cards and Keys ###

Physical security is tight

One of our agents has been cozy with some of the casino members, so much so

We have a scanned copy of almost 200 NFC keycards, 
However, the cards are useless without the owner's personal code.

Not to worry as we have scraped almost 500 potential passwords off their credentials server,
However they are onto us as the transfer was cut mid-session.

We are hoping there is at least 1 valid keycard and password combination.

Good luck
